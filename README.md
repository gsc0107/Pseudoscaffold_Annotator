# Pseudoscaffold_Annotator
### A program to annotate an assembled pseudoscaffold
___
___

This is a program for annotating an assembled pseudoscaffold using a reference genome and annotation file. Currently, this only supports using and writing in the GFF3 format. Support for the BED format will come later.

**NOTE: This program is currently under testing. I do _not_ recommend use of this program for any important uses just yet**
