# Pseudoscaffold_Annotator
### A program to annotate an assembled pseudoscaffold
___
___

This is a program for annotating an assembled pseudoscaffold using a reference genome and annotation file. Currently, this only supports using and writing in the GFF3 format. Support for the BED format will come later.

This program requires Python 2.7 or higher, or the `argparse` module installed for Python 2.6

The BEDTools Suite is also required. It can be downloaded from GitHub.

**NOTE: This program is currently under testing. I do _not_ recommend use of this program for any important uses just yet**

## TODO

 - Add support for extracting information from BED file
 - Add BED to GFF annotating capabilities
 - Add GFF to BED annotating capabilities
 - Finish GFF to GFF annotation capabilities
 - Add BED to BED annotating capabilities
